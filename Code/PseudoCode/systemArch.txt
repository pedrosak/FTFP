-Function to monitor LED/initialize system
-Go into line following

	-Need functions that move robot based on inches
		-Forward(int distance), etc.
-Function to handle each challenge
-Function to handle departure
-"Master" function: this will call all sub functions based on flags
-array for challenges that have been completed
	-can help to prevent false positives
-junction detection with camera
	-add in flow, initialization to pi
		-Brian


-Objects  that should be created (Will help to reduce the amount of code in the "main" file)
	-Challenges
		-something like "if we see simon, call Challenges.simon"
	-TaskArea
